### The name of my application is `APPDOME`.

Here, users can learn detailed information about an app â€” such as its `rating`, `reviews`, and `number of downloads`, among others. From this website, users can also easily install an app.

Once a user installs an app, they cannot install it again until they uninstall it. The installed apps are stored in the user's browser local storage. When an app is uninstalled, its ID is removed from local storage, making it available for installation again.
